# MyTie

MyTie is a personal project I began working on in August 2020. While my primary goal with this project is to learn and grow, I do plan to release the mobile app in the Google Play store sometime in the near future...

## About The App
MyTie is a mobile app targeting Android devices (for now at least). The goal of the app is to create a flexible mobile app for fly fishing that allows users to filter and search fly tying patterns based on materials the user has on hand. The app also allows users to contribute to the app by uploading additional fly patterns with photos and instructions for other users to tie the fly.

## Technologies
MyTie is built with Dart and the Flutter SDK, as well as Cloud Firestore for its database.
